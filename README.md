# space-visualizations

Visualizing functions and spaces in multiple dimensions through coloring techniques, vector fields, user manipulation, and perspective changes. Relies on Java StdDraw drawing for rendering shapes.

To run the program:

Set current working directory to spacevisuals
% cd spacevisuals

Ensure you have access permissions
% chmod +x run.sh

Start the program with arguments[i=0]
% ./run.sh <arguments[i]> <arguments[i+1]>

Help:
animation options:

animation input parameters should be based on the same space, meaning either all 2D spaces or all 3D spaces.
